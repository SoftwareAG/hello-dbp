# About Hello DBP
Hello DBP is a demo / tutorial in the spirit of HelloWorld in your favorite programming language. It's purpose is to showcase the simplest use cases across many of Software AG's Digital Business Platform (DBP) capabilities. Other, more polished, demos and videos provide a more comprehensive look at smaller subsets of the DBP.

# Structure
As you will discover from the videos, the structure of Hello DBP is a series of sprints, each with a short introduction of the business problem and technical approach to implementation, followed by a six minute live development phase and a closing with a brief sprint demo.
